% Linear Systems II: the Signal Separators
% This is the main script for our project. 

% Needs to run the record audio function here
% and return normalized Y and Fs.

% Then, pass Y and Fs to a separate signal function
% which returns a vector of integers

% Then, call send_text_message.m to send the text.
